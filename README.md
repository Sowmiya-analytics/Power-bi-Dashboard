# Power-bi-Dashboard
This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing Olympic Games data. It offers insights into medal distribution by sport, country, gender, and athlete performance. The dashboard is interactive and provides a high-level overview along with deep dives into specific data points.

# Key Insights and features
- The United States leads in total medals won.
- Athletics is the most medal-heavy sport.
- Participation by women has increased significantly after 1950.
- Soviet Union athletes like Nikolay Andrianov and Larysa Latynina were top medalists.
- - Total medal count and medal breakdown (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
- Total athletes participated across Olympic history.
- Medal distribution by sport, including most successful sports.
- Gender-wise analysis of participants over the years.
- Country-wise medal performance with a bar chart breakdown.
- Top 5 athletes by total medals won and their countries.

# Why This Project Stands Out
1.  Data Rich Visuals: The dashboard includes multiple types of visualizations (bar charts, line charts, KPIs), making the data easy to interpret and insightful for users.
2.  Gender Analysis: Unique gender-based participation visualization provides demographic insights over time.
3.  Athlete Recognition: Highlights top-performing athletes, offering recognition and context beyond just countries.
4.  Country Comparison: Clearly shows how different countries have performed over time, encouraging cross-country analysis.
5.  Usability: The interface is clean, modern, and interactive, built using effective Power BI visual features.
